In August 2022, I discovered a new PHP threat where the encoded script is being signed with 'I could not have a more welcome visitor 64 group of zain bani'

I have decoded a few variations of this PHP code where one of the one variation was hiding the Leaf PHPMailer. 

In the version uploaded here, when decoding there is a strange encoding that I cannot break. 

I've opened this up to the community to see if someone can break it.

When we decode level 1 of the encoding we are presented with the image below.
